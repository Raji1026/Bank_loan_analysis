# Bank_loan_analysis
**Statement:**  
A leading banking institution has been providing diverse loan products to its customers for the past 15 years. However, due to rising competition, higher default rates, and suboptimal loan distribution strategies, the bank is experiencing a decline in its profitability and market share. To address these challenges, the management decided to implement a data-driven approach to assess the financial impact of its loan portfolio and optimize loan policies. With limited in-house analytical capabilities, the bank has tasked you, a data analyst, to analyze their historical loan data and provide actionable insights.  

**Task:**  
- Analyze historical loan data to identify trends, default patterns, and profitability metrics for various loan types and customer segments.  
- Design and develop a dashboard that aligns with stakeholders’ expectations, enabling real-time tracking of key loan performance indicators (KPIs).  
- Derive additional insights beyond the provided metrics to enhance understanding of risk factors and loan allocation strategies.  
- Provide data-driven recommendations to optimize loan distribution policies and improve the bank’s overall economic performance.  
**Reasons for Analysing Bank Loan Data:**
Banks analyse loan data for several critical reasons:
Risk Assessment: One of the primary purposes of analysing loan data is to assess the risk associated with lending to a particular individual or business. Banks use data to evaluate the creditworthiness of borrowers, predict default probabilities, and determine interest rates and lending terms.
Decision-making: Loan data analysis supports the decision-making process when evaluating loan applications. Banks use data-driven models and algorithms to make informed lending decisions, such as approving or denying loan requests.
Portfolio Management: Banks manage portfolios of loans, including mortgages, personal loans, and business loans. Data analysis helps banks monitor the health of these portfolios, identify underperforming loans, and optimize loan terms and pricing.
Fraud Detection: Banks use data analysis to detect fraudulent loan applications and activities. Unusual patterns, inconsistencies, or discrepancies in loan data can trigger fraud alerts.
Regulatory Compliance: Banks are subject to regulatory requirements that mandate the collection and reporting of loan data. Compliance with regulations such as the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) and the Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations requires data analysis and reporting.
Customer Insights: Analysing loan data provides insights into customer behaviour, preferences, and needs. Banks can use these insights to tailor loan products and marketing strategies to specific customer segments.
Profitability Analysis: Banks assess the profitability of their loan portfolios by analysing data related to interest income, loan origination costs, default rates, and collection efforts.
Market Research: Data analysis helps banks understand market trends, competitive landscape, and customer demand. This information guides product development and market expansion strategies.
Credit Risk Management: Banks continuously monitor and manage credit risk associated with their loans. Data analysis helps in setting risk management strategies, provisioning for potential losses, and stress testing loan portfolios.
Customer Retention: Banks use data analysis to identify opportunities for retaining existing customers, such as offering loan refinancing options or additional financial products.
